A basic overview of what DeepL Pro plans include is as follows:     </p>     <ul>         <li>The guarantee that your texts are not stored for any purpose</li>         <li>Unlimited use of the Web Translator (except DeepL API plan)</li>         <li>Fully-editable document translations</li>         <li>Integration of DeepL\'s translation engine into CAT tools (Advanced and Ultimate plans)</li>         <li>Access to the DeepL API (DeepL API plan only)</li>     </ul>     <p>         Please also consult our <a href=\\"/pro-pricing.html\\">Pricing page</a> for further information.     </p>","pro_languages_question":"Which language pairs does DeepL Pro support?","pro_languages_answer":"<p>      DeepL Pro supports translations in the same language combinations as available on DeepL Translator.

Further languages will become available in the near future.     </p>","pro_subscription_costs_question":"How much does a DeepL Pro subscription cost?","pro_subscription_costs_answer":"<p>         DeepL Pro offers options for both individuals, teams, and developers and is available through several different plans. Prices depend on how much you would like to translate, how many team members you have, and how (or if) you would like to integrate DeepL\'s translation technology into various platforms.           For more detailed information, please also consult our <a href=\\"/pro-pricing.html\\">Pricing page</a>.     </p>","pro_subscription_period_question":"What is the contract duration of a DeepL Pro subscription?","pro_subscription_period_answer":"<p>         DeepL Pro plans are available on both monthly and annual payment schedules. The minimum duration of any plan is one month (one billing period). In the case of annual plans, the billing period is equal to one year.             You can cancel your subscription at any time before the end of the current billing period.         The contract then runs until the end of that billing period and will not be renewed.     </p>","pro_billing_timing_question":"When will I be charged?","pro_billing_timing_answer":"<p>        Annual plans are paid up front, after the conclusion of your free trial period (with the exception of Ultimate plans). With monthly billing, payment is due at the beginning of each monthly billing period.       </p>        <p>Please note: The DeepL API plan is available only on a monthly basis. The base price (€4.99) and usage-based charges are paid at the end of the billing period. Two exceptions to this rule apply. If, in the first billing period of a new DeepL API subscription, costs (base price plus usage) reach €50, DeepL reserves the right to charge the credit card provided by the customer immediately, as a guarantee of payment. Subsequently, when costs exceed €500 within one billing period, this amount is charged each time it is reached. At the end of the billing period, any outstanding costs will be charged as normal.        </p>","pro_million_characters_enough_question":"Will {{separatedCharacterLimit}} characters be enough?","pro_million_characters_enough_answer":"<p>         {{separatedCharacterLimit}} characters is hard to fathom. If we consider that a word, on average, contains 7 characters (though this may vary, depending on language), {{separatedCharacterLimit}} characters corresponds to some 140 000 words.          To make it easier to visualize the translation capacity that comes with a DeepL Pro subscription, it may help to think of well-known works of literature.           William Shakespeare\'s <i>Hamlet</i> contains roughly 180 000 characters, meaning you could translate it five and a half times in one month.     </p>      <div class=\\"dl_faq_price_example__table\\">         <table id=\\"dl_price_examples\\">             <thead>                 <tr><th>Title</th><th>Author</th><th>Character count</th><th>Translations with {{separatedCharacterLimit}} characters</th></tr>             </thead>                              <tr><td>US Bill of Rights</td><td>J.

We offer several plans and the flexibility to customize those plans and switch between them, should your needs change.          After signing up for a DeepL Pro plan, options to change your plan can be found on your Account page.          Upgrades take place immediately, whereas a switch to a more limited plan will take effect at the end of the current billing period.     </p>","pro_available_payment_options_question":"What payment methods do you accept?","pro_available_payment_options_answer":"<p>         We accept payment by credit card and direct debit (SEPA).          For European countries, team plans billed annually may also be paid by bank transfer in euros (EUR, €).         We accept euros (EUR, €), Japanese yen (JPY, ¥), American dollars (USD, $), and Canadian dollars (CAD, $).     </p>","pro_monthlyVsAnnual_question":"What’s the difference between monthly and annual billing?","pro_monthlyVsAnnual_answer":"<p>         Annual billing offers the greatest savings; monthly billing offers the greatest flexibility.         If you opt for annual billing, the full year is paid up front, after the conclusion of your free trial period (with the exception of Ultimate plans).         With monthly billing, payment is due at the beginning of each monthly billing period. However, this does not apply to the DeepL API plan, which is billed at the end of each monthly billing period.         Both payment schedules allow you to modify or cancel your plan.     </p>","pro_const_control_question":"How can I limit my maximum costs (cost control)?","pro_const_control_answer":"<p>     The DeepL API plan offers you the option to set a limit on the number of characters that you can translate per month and thereby control your maximum costs.     You need only activate Cost Control in your <a href=\\"/pro-account.html\\">Account settings</a>.     Simply click \\"Change cost control settings,\\" tick the checkbox to enable, and enter either the maximum number of characters     or the maximum amount and apply the changes. You can make further changes at any time.     </p>","pro_counting_characters_question":"How are the characters counted for billing?","pro_counting_characters_answer":"<p> The DeepL API plan places no limit on the amount that you can translate, and counts your usage by the character.          The characters counted are those in the source text, i.e. the original text you would like to translate.         <br>         One character corresponds to one unicode <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point\\">code point</a>, where a single character can consist of several bytes.         For example, the character <strong>é</strong> is represented as two bytes in UTF-8.         However, DeepL only considers this as one character.         Invisible characters such as spaces, tabs, line feeds, etc. are also counted.     </p>","pro_document_translation_characters_question":"How do translated documents contribute to my monthly usage?","pro_document_translation_characters_answer":"<p>         All document translations contribute to your overall monthly character count (usage). The number of characters added to the monthly total begins at 50 000 per file, even if the document contains fewer characters.         Translations of documents containing more than 50 000 characters are added to your monthly usage to the exact character.</p>     <br>     <p>     See the table below for two examples.     </p>   <div class=\\"dl_faq_document_translation_characters_table\\">         <table id=\\"dl_document_examples\\">             <thead>                 <tr><th> </th><th>Document character count</th><th>DeepL Pro characters used</th></tr>             </thead>                              <tr><td>Document1.docx</td><td>35 652</td><td>50 000</td></tr>                 <tr><td>Document2.docx</td><td>81 605</td><td>81 605</td></tr>                      </table>     </div>","pro_document_translation_formats_question":"Which file formats can I translate?","pro_document_translation_formats_answer":"<p>         Microsoft Word (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx) files can be translated using the free version of DeepL Translator.          DeepL Pro subscribers can also translate plain text (.txt) files, and the DeepL API plan also enables translation of HTML (.htm and .html) files.   Note that files must be uploaded one at a time.          For further information about which file formats can be translated in CAT tools, please contact the CAT tool provider.     </p>","pro_changeDocQuota_question":"Can I change the number of document translations included in my DeepL Pro plan?","pro_changeDocQuota_answer":"<p>         After signing up for a DeepL Pro plan, you always have the option to add more document translations to your plan.         As with other changes to your plan, you can do this from your Account page.     </p>","pro_addTeamMembers_question":"Can I add people to my DeepL Pro plan?","pro_addTeamMembers_answer":"<p>         You can change your subscription from an individual plan to a team plan at any time.         You also have the option to set the number of users on your team plan as you like.         You can make these changes on your Account page.         Please note: The minimum number of users on a team plan is two.     </p>","privacy_headline":"Data Protection","privacy_data-storage_question":"Does DeepL Pro store any of my translation requests?","privacy_data-storage_answer":"<p>         DeepL Pro does not store the texts from your requests or their translations.

This also means that any changes you make to the translation will not add to the final character count.     </p>","catTools_which_version_question":"How do I know if my CAT tool supports DeepL Pro integration?","catTools_which_version_answer":"<p>         The DeepL Pro plug-in may only be supported in certain versions or editions of the CAT tool providers’ products.

This equates to 420 000 characters, leaving 580 000.     </p>     <p>   This means that if even the fastest of translators doubled their speed thanks to DeepL Pro, they still would not exceed the million-character limit.     </p>     <p>   (These figures may vary depending on the source language).     </p>","api_headline":"API Access","api_getAPIPlan_question":"How do I get access to DeepL’s API?","api_getAPIPlan_answer":"<p>         The DeepL API plan is specifically designed for software developers to build new software and applications on top of our translation technology.         Please note that the DeepL API plan is the only plan that allows this.         Also, the DeepL API plan does not allow you to use DeepL Pro within translation software.     </p>","api_api-key_question":"What is the Authentication Key and where can I find it?","api_api-key_answer":"<p>  The Authentication Key is a code that enables DeepL Pro subscribers access to our API. The Authentication Key looks similar to “df4385c2-33de-e423-4134-ca1f7b3ea8b7”.  You can find your unique Authentication Key in your DeepL Pro <a href=\\"/pro-account.html\\">Account page</a>.     </p>","api_source_lang_question":"In which cases should I specify the source language?","api_source_lang_answer":"<p>DeepL Pro can automatically recognize the language of a text. The reliability of the result increases with the length of the text, and short texts can sometimes lead to incorrect results.</p>     <p>If you specify the language of the text in a query, the DeepL Pro translator always uses that language.     If you know the language of the source text, you should use the <tt>source_lang</tt> parameter to specify the corresponding code.</p>","api_tag_handling_question":"What does tag handling do?","api_tag_handling_answer":"<p>With tag handling enabled, you can translate sentences with tags (e.g. XML tags).     The translation engine will map the tags onto the appropriate location in the target sentence as well as it can.     Please consult the <a href=\\"/docs-api.html\\">API documentation</a> for detailed information on types of tags supported.</p>     <p>Please note that the DeepL API does not currently translate whole XML files.</p>","api_split_sentences_question":"When should I disable the sentence splitter?","api_split_sentences_answer":"<p>The sentence splitter splits the source text into individual sentences.     However, if you only send single sentences to the API, you can disable the sentence splitter so that the text is translated as one sentence.</p>","api_post_get_question":"Can API requests also be submitted as POST requests?","api_post_get_answer":"<p>Yes, this is actually advisable for long texts, since the length of URLs is limited by the web server.</p>","api_uri_too_long_question":"How can I avoid error 414, \\"Request-URI Too Long\\"?","api_uri_too_long_answer":"<p>This error occurs if the API URLs are too long and is due to a length limit of the web server.     You can avoid this error message by using a POST request instead of a GET request.</p>","api_post_request_question":"How do I send a translation request as a POST request?","api_post_request_answer":"<p>         In a POST request, you do not send the data in the URL, but rather as data in the <emph>body</emph> of the request.         There exist libraries for most programming languages to support the easy sending of POST requests.     </p>     <p>However, if you have to create a POST request yourself, you should consider the following points:         <ol>             <li>Use <tt>POST</tt> as the request method.</li>             <li>Set the <tt>Content-Type</tt> request header to <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt>.</li>             <li>Set the <tt>Content-Length</tt> request header to the number of bytes in the request body.</li>             <li>Insert your translation request parameters into the request body.             The parameters should be URL-encoded using the UTF-8 character set.             In other words, the body looks exactly like the <emph>query</emph> part of the equivalent GET-request (the characters after the question mark of a GET-request).             </li><li>Use the same URL as for GET-requests, but without parameters, i.e. <tt>https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate</tt>.</li>         </ol>     </p>     <p>The request <tt>https://api.deepl.com/v2/translate?auth_key=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&text=This%20is%20a%20Test.&target_lang=EN</tt>     should look like this as a POST request:</p>     <pre> POST /v2/translate HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 87  auth_key=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&text=This%20is%20a%20Test.&target_lang=EN     </pre>","api_link_generator_question":"How can I create URL examples for API requests?","api_link_generator_answer":"You can use this form to generate sample URLs for the <a href=\\"/docs-api.html\\">DeepL API</a>.
