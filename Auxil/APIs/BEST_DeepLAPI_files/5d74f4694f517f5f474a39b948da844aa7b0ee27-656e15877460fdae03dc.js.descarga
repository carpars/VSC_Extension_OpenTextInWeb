Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Customer and DeepL expressly agree and intend that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement. For purposes of this Section, “<strong>Claims</strong>” means collectively, and without limitation, any and all claims, injuries, demands, liabilities, disputes, causes of action (including statutory, contract, negligence, or other tort theories), proceedings, obligations, debts, liens, fines, charges, penalties, contracts, promises, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees, whether incurred pre-litigation, pre-trial, at trial, on appeal, or otherwise), damages of any kind whatsoever (including consequential, compensatory, or punitive damages), or losses (whether known, unknown, asserted, non-asserted, fixed, conditional, or contingent) that arise from or relate to (i) the Products, including any and all contents, materials and software related thereto, and/or (ii) Customer’s use of the Products.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.2</span>                         <p>Informal Resolution of Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any Claim arises out of or relates to the Products or this Agreement, other than as may be provided herein, then Customer and DeepL agree to send notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Claim, along with a proposed resolution of it. DeepL notice to Customer will be sent to Customer based on the most recent contact information that Customer provide DeepL. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, DeepL has no obligation under this Section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Customer and DeepL will engage in a dialog to attempt to resolve the Claim, though nothing will require either Customer or DeepL to resolve the Claim on terms with respect to which Customer and DeepL, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3</span>                         <p>Binding Arbitration. If Customer and DeepL cannot resolve a Claim, within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice, then Customer agree that that any such Claim and all other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration relating to Customer’s use of the Products, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The FAA, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of such disputes, including the class action waiver below. However, Customer and DeepL agree that California state law or United States federal law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all Claims or disputes arising between Customer and DeepL regarding this Agreement and the Products, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to choice of law principles. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. <strong>THIS SECTION, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS ON BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT OR CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE PRODUCTS.</strong></p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.1</span>                         <p>Initiating Arbitration. To begin an arbitration proceeding, Customer must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing Customer’s claim to DeepL at DeepL GmbH, Maarweg 165, 50825 Cologne, Germany or e-mail: support@deepl.com. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS\'s rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California or at such other venue (and pursuant to such procedures) as is mutually agreed upon. Customer can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: JAMS: 800.352.5267 and http://www.jamsadr.com.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.2</span>                         <p>Fees. Customer and DeepL will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require DeepL to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then DeepL will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Arbitration rules may permit Customer to recover attorneys’ fees. DeepL will not seek to recover attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.3</span>                         <p><strong>Class Action Waiver.

Notwithstanding the agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, Customer or DeepL may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights, but not including privacy rights). Customer or DeepL may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. In the event that the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to Customer or to a particular Claim, either as a result of Customer’s decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, Customer agree that the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California. Customer and DeepL agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such Claims or any other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement or Customer’s use of the Products in the event that the arbitration provisions are found not to apply. In such a case, should DeepL prevail in litigation against Customer to enforce its rights under this Agreement, DeepL shall be entitled to its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees (whether incurred at or in preparation for trial, appeal or otherwise) incurred in resolving or settling the dispute, in addition to all other damages or awards to which DeepL may be entitled.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.5</span>                         <p><strong>Limited Time to File Claims.

Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Customer and DeepL expressly agree and intend that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement. For purposes of this Section, “<strong>Claims</strong>” means collectively, and without limitation, any and all claims, injuries, demands, liabilities, disputes, causes of action (including statutory, contract, negligence, or other tort theories), proceedings, obligations, debts, liens, fines, charges, penalties, contracts, promises, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees, whether incurred pre-litigation, pre-trial, at trial, on appeal, or otherwise), damages of any kind whatsoever (including consequential, compensatory, or punitive damages), or losses (whether known, unknown, asserted, non-asserted, fixed, conditional, or contingent) that arise from or relate to (i) the Products, including any and all contents, materials and software related thereto, and/or (ii) Customer’s use of the Products.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.2</span>                         <p>Informal Resolution of Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any Claim arises out of or relates to the Products or this Agreement, other than as may be provided herein, then Customer and DeepL agree to send notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Claim, along with a proposed resolution of it. DeepL notice to Customer will be sent to Customer based on the most recent contact information that Customer provide DeepL. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, DeepL has no obligation under this Section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Customer and DeepL will engage in a dialog to attempt to resolve the Claim, though nothing will require either Customer or DeepL to resolve the Claim on terms with respect to which Customer and DeepL, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3</span>                         <p>Binding Arbitration. If Customer and DeepL cannot resolve a Claim, within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice, then Customer agree that that any such Claim and all other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration relating to Customer’s use of the Products, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. The FAA, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of such disputes, including the class action waiver below. However, Customer and DeepL agree that California state law or United States federal law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all Claims or disputes arising between Customer and DeepL regarding this Agreement and the Products, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to choice of law principles. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. <strong>THIS SECTION, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS ON BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT OR CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE PRODUCTS.</strong></p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.1</span>                         <p>Initiating Arbitration. To begin an arbitration proceeding, Customer must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing Customer’s claim to DeepL at DeepL GmbH, Maarweg 165, 50825 Cologne, Germany or e-mail: support@deepl.com. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS\'s rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California or at such other venue (and pursuant to such procedures) as is mutually agreed upon. Customer can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: JAMS: 800.352.5267 and http://www.jamsadr.com.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.2</span>                         <p>Fees. Customer and DeepL will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require DeepL to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then DeepL will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Arbitration rules may permit Customer to recover attorneys’ fees. DeepL will not seek to recover attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.3</span>                         <p><strong>Class Action Waiver. CUSTOMER AND DEEPL EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

Notwithstanding the agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, Customer or DeepL may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights, but not including privacy rights). Customer or DeepL may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. In the event that the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to Customer or to a particular Claim, either as a result of Customer’s decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, Customer agree that the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California. Customer and DeepL agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such Claims or any other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement or Customer’s use of the Products in the event that the arbitration provisions are found not to apply. In such a case, should DeepL prevail in litigation against Customer to enforce its rights under this Agreement, DeepL shall be entitled to its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees (whether incurred at or in preparation for trial, appeal or otherwise) incurred in resolving or settling the dispute, in addition to all other damages or awards to which DeepL may be entitled.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                         <span class=\\"dl_paragraph_number\\">15.3.5</span>                         <p><strong>Limited Time to File Claims.
